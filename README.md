# About me 👋

Developer with hands-on experience and a growth mindset.  
I’m naturally curious and have a horizontal approach to technology, from low-level programming to full-stack web development.  
I love taking on new challenges like CTFs, hackathons, ML, and Web3 projects, always learning something new along the way.  
I enjoy solving complex problems and building useful, reliable, and scalable solutions. 💻🚀
